DDL (Data Definition Language) refers to the CREATE, ALTER and DROP statements
DDL allows to add / modify / delete the logical structures which contain the data or which allow users to access / maintain the data (databases, tables, keys, views...). DDL is about "metadata".

DML (Data Manipulation Language) refers to the INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements
DML allows to add / modify / delete data itself.

DQL (Data Query Language) refers to the SELECT, SHOW and HELP statements (queries)
SELECT is the main DQL instruction. It retrieves data you need. SHOW retrieves information about the metadata. HELP... is for people who need help.

DCL (Data Control Language) refers to the GRANT and REVOKE statements
DCL is used to grant / revoke permissions on databases and their contents. DCL is simple, but MySQL's permissions are rather complex. DCL is about security.

DTL (Data Transaction Language) refers to the START TRANSACTION, SAVEPOINT, COMMIT and ROLLBACK [TO SAVEPOINT] statements
DTL is used to manage transactions (operations which include more instructions none of which can be executed if one of them fails).


Data Definition Language (DDL) statements are used to define the database structure or schema. Some examples:
CREATE - to create objects in the database
ALTER - alters the structure of the database
DROP - delete objects from the database
TRUNCATE - remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed. The operation cannot be rolled back.
COMMENT - add comments to the data dictionary
RENAME - rename an object

DML
Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements are used for managing data within schema objects. Some examples:
SELECT - retrieve data from the a database
INSERT - insert data into a table
UPDATE - updates existing data within a table
DELETE - deletes all records from a table, the space for the records remain. Can be rolled back. Must me committed to make changes permanent.
MERGE - UPSERT operation (insert or update)
CALL - call a PL/SQL or Java subprogram
EXPLAIN PLAN - explain access path to data
LOCK TABLE - control concurrency

DCL
Data Control Language (DCL) statements. Some examples:
GRANT - gives user's access privileges to database
REVOKE - withdraw access privileges given with the GRANT command
TCL

Transaction Control (TCL) statements are used to manage the changes made by DML statements. It allows statements to be grouped together into logical transactions.
COMMIT - save work done
SAVEPOINT - identify a point in a transaction to which you can later roll back
ROLLBACK - restore database to original since the last COMMIT
SET TRANSACTION - Change transaction options like isolation level and what rollback segment to use

Note:
DROP and TRUNCATE are DDL commands, whereas DELETE is a DML command. Therefore DELETE operations can be rolled back (undone), while DROP and TRUNCATE operations cannot be rolled back.
