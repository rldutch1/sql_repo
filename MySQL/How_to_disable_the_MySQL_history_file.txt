How to disable the .mysql_history file from being created:
Sometimes itâ€™s a good idea to prevent mysql from writing a history file. The mysql history file contains all the commands you type across all sessions.

        Your default mysql history file is ~/.mysql_history.
        As this is an obvious security risk, it is sometimes a good idea to disable this file.
        To disable mysql history do the following:
        Delete your existing ~/.mysql_history file.
        Edit your ~/.profile file and add the following:

        export MYSQL_HISTFILE=/dev/null
        This directs your mysql history to /dev/null

        Apply your changes with:
        source ~/.profile
        Login into mysql and run some commands.

        Logout.

        Verify that the ~/.mysql_history file has not been created :)
