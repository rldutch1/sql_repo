Question:
Got error "SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] Permission denied" on webpage using PHP to connect to database.

Answer:
This happen because selinux avoid db connections from the httpd server to the remote db server. To solve it you need to access your server trough ssh or just open a console if you have pretencial acces and do the follow:

You must check in the SELinux if the port 80 is managed in. You can check it typing # semanage port -l | grep http_port_t for list and check:

http_port_t                    tcp      443, 488, 8008, 8009, 8443, 9000

If you need to add the required port, just type:

# semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 80

Type the command to ckeck once again:

# semanage port -l | grep http_port_t

.

http_port_t                    tcp      80, 443, 488, 8008, 8009, 8443, 9000

Then you should notify SELinux you want to allow network connections from the httpd server to the db remote server, seting the boolean variables that set it:

Down the httpd service # service httpd stop
# setsebool httpd_can_network_connect 1
# setsebool httpd_can_network_connect_db 1
Up the httpd service # service httpd start
Now your httpd service should be capable to get data from the db server.

I hope that can be usefull for the gang that search solve errors like this.

From Chile, best regards.
