Installing MariaDB or MySQL Server on Fedora:
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/installing-mysql-mariadb/
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/MariaDB

sudo dnf -y install mariadb-server

Change the OS root password from whatever it may be after the OS install to a password that you choose:
	sudo passwd root

Start the mariaDB server: 
	systemctl start mariadb

Start the MariaDB server on boot:
	systemctl enable mariadb
	
Then start the mysql_secure_installation process. Make sure to set the database root user password during the mysql_secure_installation. Otherwise, you will have to log into mysql using: sudo mysql.
	[rob@gemini ~]$ sudo mysql_secure_installation

Log in as root:
	mysql -u root -p

Create your own user and password:
	% = remote user (used when logging in from another system)
	localhost = local user

	CREATE USER 'theusername'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'SomePassword';
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'theusername'@'%'
	WITH GRANT OPTION;

	CREATE USER 'theusername'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'SomePassword';
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'theusername'@'localhost'
	WITH GRANT OPTION;

Firewall
MariaDB operates on port 3306 (or whatever else you set in your my.cnf). In firewalld you can open it like this:

	$ #Make it last after reboot
		$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=3306/tcp
	$ #Change runtime configuration
		$ sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=3306/tcp

	In case of iptables:
		$ iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3306 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

Default installation and configuration files:
The configuration files are stored in the /etc/my.cnf.d/ directory and the main configuration file is /etc/my.cnf

The default log file is /var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log
The default installation directory is /var/lib/mysql
