MariaDB:
	CREATE USER 'TheUserName'@'%' IDENTIFIED VIA mysql_native_password USING 'ThePassword';
	GRANT USAGE ON TheDatabaseName.* TO 'TheUserName'@'%'
	REQUIRE NONE WITH
	MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 0
	MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR 0
	MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR 0
	MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 0;

--This worked on a fresh install of MariaDB.
When using the "identified via mysql_native_password option using" option, I got an error saying,
"You must SET PASSWORD/Password hash should be a 41-digit hexadecimal number".
To solve I used the "PASSWORD()" function which will correctly hash the password according to the method configured in "old_passwords".

	This worked:
	CREATE USER 'TheUserName'@'%';
	SET PASSWORD FOR 'TheUserName'@'%' = PASSWORD('ThePassword');
	grant all privileges on TheUserName.* to 'TheUserName'@'%'
	require none with grant option
	max_queries_per_hour 0
	max_connections_per_hour 0
	max_updates_per_hour 0
	max_user_connections 0;
	flush privileges;

	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `TheDatabaseName`.* TO 'TheUserName'@'%';
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `TheDatabaseName\_%`.* TO 'TheUserName'@'%';

ERROR 1372 (HY000): Password hash should be a 41-digit hexadecimal

	Use the generated hashed password in your create user statement:
	CREATE USER 'testing123'@'%' IDENTIFIED VIA mysql_native_password USING '*2B0BDFDD205F1119FCDF458C2BF777333C498C9A';
